      <h3 class="heading" id="1">Disease</h3>
			<p>Heart disease is a chronic disease that occurs when the heart is not pumping blood as well as it should be, this can be caused by many factors such as narrowed arteries in your heart or high blood pressure. </p>
			<p>Signs and symptoms of heart failure might include<ul>
      <li>Shortness of breathe when lying down or exerting onesself
      <li>Fatigue and weakness
      <li>Swelling in your legs, ankles and feet
      <li>Rapid or irregular heartbeat
      <li>Reduced ability to exercise
      <li>Persistent cough or wheezing with white or pink blood-tinged phlegm
      <li>Increased need to urinate at night
      <li>Swelling of your abdomen
      <li>Very rapid weight gain from fluid retention
      <li>Lack of appetite and nausea
      <li>Difficulty concentrating or decreased alertness
      <li>Sudden, severe shortness of breath and coughing up pink, foamy mucus
      <li>Chest pain if your heart failure is caused by a heart attack
      </ul></p>
			<p>Heart failure is not curable but some of the conditions are reversible, such treatments would include lifestyle changes, medication, devices and medical procedures, and ongoing care. If you were to get in contact with a team of doctors about heart disease, there is a chance that they could fix heart failure by treating the cause of the failure such as a weak heart valve. These treatments would have to be done all your life and can only reduce your chances of death.</p>
		</div>

      <h3 class="heading" id="2">Body system</h3>
			<p>Heart failure causes less blood to get pumped, this means that the heart must grow larger and pump harder in order to keep up. As the heart works harder, the damage increases causing the heart to grow weaker and be less able to supply oxygen, this causes issues for the circulatory system but also for many other systems such as the digestive and renal system as a lack of blood can seriously damage the kidneys and liver, it can also damage your nervous system as less blood would mean damage to the brain from a lack of nutrients.</p>
      <br>
			<p> <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/geKSI6rhBxoXpTKtS1asqGa86l_GhkWXe69bMWYl0wztB8HfWfpC8PK7DVOOVMyJpZv5d8DEAlU0v8VMHq37cP76u9LS9YxmmBzWzORaqgupjXunUQLzPM2bAL7M7ZrW8B4nXhKKuZOETA" alt="Diagram of circulatory syste," style="float:right;width:505px;height:533px;">The circulatory system is a set of veins, arteries, and capillaries made to transport nutrients and oxygen throughout the entire body via blood. This is achieved by the heart beating to pump the blood through the arteries and veins. These nutrients are crucial to cell growth and reproduction which is what keeps us alive. </p>
			<p>Each parts function
        <ul>
              <li> Lungs: Gather oxygen to disolve in blood and transport around the body
              <li> Veins: Return deoxygenated blood
              <li> Venules: Connects veins to capillaries
              <li> Tissue capillaries: Sends nutrients to the cells
              <li> Arteries: Sends blood away from heart
             <li> Aorta: Largest blood vessels in the body
             <li> Arterioles: Similar to arteries
            <li> Pulmonary artery: Carries oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>When the circulatory system is damaged, many other systems are hurt too. A lack of blood will cause nutrient deficiency in the body as the body is unable to get nutrients to the cells of the body. This will cause the muscular and skeletal system to wither away as they can no longer sustain themselves. It also would cause the brain to start to lose function as well due to a lack of nutrients</p>

         The doctor would also ask to check for the presence of risk factors such as high blood pressure </p>
			<p>After the physical exam, the doctor might continue on to do one of the following tests
        <ul>

			<h3 class="heading" id="4">Prevention</h3>
			<p>One way to prevent heart failure is to prevent and control conditions that cause heart failure, such as coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, diabetes or obesity.</p>
			<p>There are many risk factors that increase your odd of getting heart failure such as 
        <ul>
        <li><b>High blood pressure.</b> Your heart has to work harder than before.
        <li><b>Coronary artery disease. </b> Narrow arteries can deprive the heart of blood thus causing it to weaken.
        <li><b>Heart attack.</b> Heart attacks can damage your heart muscles and make it weaker than before.
        <li><b>Diabetes.</b> Diabetes increases your risk of high blood pressure and coronart heart disease
        <li><b>Some diabetes medications. </b>Diabetes medications such as Avandia have been shown to increase heart failure risk in some people, it is best to talk to a doctor before taking these.
        <li><b>Certain medications. </b>There are certain medications that may lead to heart failure such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, some anesthesias, some anti-arrhythmic medications, certain medications used to treat high blood pressure, cancer, blood conditions, neurological conditions, psychiatric conditions, lung conditions, urological conditions, inflammatory conditions and infections, and other prescription and over-the-counter medications. 
        <li><b>Sleep apnea.</b> Difficulty breathing while asleep can deprive the body of oxygen for long periods of time and lead to the same issues as coronary heart disease
        <li><b>Congenital heart defects.</b> Some people are born with heart defects than increase your chances of developing heart failure
        <li><b>Valvular heart disease.</b> People with valvular heart disease have a higher risk of heart failure. 
        <li><b>Viruses.</b> An infection can weaken and damage your heart muscles 
        <li><b>Alcohol use.</b> Too much alcohol can weaken heart muscle and lead to heart failure.
        <li><b>Tobacco use</b> Using tobacco can increase your risk of heart failure because it is a carcinogen.
        <li><b>Obesity</b> A large amount of fat can restrict your arteries and cause many issues for the heart
        <li><b>Irregular heartbeats.</b> Frequent abnormal rhythms can weaken the heart muscle and cause heart failure.
        </p>
			<p>Frequent exercise and healthy eating can help reduce your risk of heart failure. Eating proper nutrients can help keep your heart strong. Frequent exercise well reduce the size of your fat cells and unclog your valves.</p>
